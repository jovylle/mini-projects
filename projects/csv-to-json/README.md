# Dynamo Attribute CSV Normalizer

- Parses Dynamo-style CSV exports with [Papa Parse](https://www.papaparse.com) so the browser handles quoting and headers reliably.
- Unwraps Dynamo attribute wrappers (`S`, `N`, `BOOL`, `M`, `L`, etc.) while keeping real booleans and nested values intact.
- Features a refreshed UI, inline explanations, and links to the live experience plus your portfolio/contacts on `jovylle.com`.
- Deploys automatically via Netlify whenever this repo receives a push; use the home page for context and featured highlights.
